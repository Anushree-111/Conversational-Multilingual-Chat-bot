# Multilingual-Conversational-Chat-bot


This project is a conversational chatbot designed to facilitate multilingual communication. Powered by ChatterBot, it leverages natural language processing to understand and generate responses based on trained dialogue datasets. Additionally, Googletrans enables translation capabilities, allowing the bot to communicate in multiple languages by translating its responses in real-time. SpeechRecognition enables voice input, where users can speak queries that are then converted to text for processing. Tkinter provides the graphical user interface, offering a user-friendly platform for users to input queries and view bot responses in a visually appealing manner. 

A sample dataset for training has been added (dialog.txt), it consists of two columns: question \t answer \n
